### [Optimizing Snake Gameplay with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/billodalroy/Snake-Game-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning)

**Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Gymnasium

- Developed deep neural network agent using PyTorch to play classic Snake game, leveraging algorithms including DQN, Double DQN, and A2C to optimize policy. Achieved score 10x higher than baseline agent. :snake::robot::trophy:

- Engineered features and reward functions enabling agent to master Snake game environment. Compared performance of DQN, DDQN, and A2C algorithms in optimizing gameplay policy, identifying most effective techniques.

### Flight Delay Prediction

**Stack:** Python, SQL, REST API

- Built a two-stage machine learning model using Random Forest algorithms for classification and regression to predict flight arrival delays, achieving an F1 score of 0.78 and RMSE of 11.28 minutes. :airplane::watch::chart_with_upwards_trend:

- Preprocessed imbalanced flight data using SMOTE oversampling before training Random Forest models to optimize performance and reduce prediction error compared to baseline models. :airplane::chart_with_downwards_trend::chart_with_upwards_trend:
